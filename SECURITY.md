# RIOT Security Policy

All security bugs reported will be silently fixed in `master` and backported to the
previous release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a security issue is discovered, please report it to security@riot-os.org.
A response will be provided within one week.
The issue will be tracked in the [security mailing list](security@riot-os.org).
The original reporter will be included in the discussion of the issue.

## Notification of a Vulnerability

After a fix is provided the security issue will be privately disclosed to the original
reporter, RIOT security maintainers, and [trusted RIOT users]().
A public announcement of the security fix will be made two weeks after the point release,
though this may vary depending on the severity and ability of trusted RIOT users to
provide the fix.
